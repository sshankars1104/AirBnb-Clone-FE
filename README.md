# Airbnb Clone (Front End)

## Project Description

This project is an Airbnb clone built to practice and demonstrate frontend development skills using React. The application features a dynamic and interactive user interface, including components for login and registration, state management using React state and Context API, and client-side routing with React Router.

## Design Phase

- **UI/UX Design**: Focused on creating an intuitive user experience with a clean and modern interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to ensure compatibility across various screen sizes.

## Development Phase

### Frontend Development

- **React**: Utilized React for building the user interface, taking advantage of its component-based architecture.
- **Component Structure**:

  - **Header**: Fixed header with logo, search bar, and user options.
  - **Footer**: Contains links and other relevant information.
  - **PropertyList**: Displays a list of properties.
  - **PropertyCard**: Shows individual property details.
  - **Filters**: Allows users to filter properties by various criteria.
  - **Login**: User login form.

- **State Management**:

  - Used React's `useState` for managing local component state, particularly for form inputs and validation messages.
  - Implemented Context API for managing global state across the application, ensuring consistency and ease of data flow.
